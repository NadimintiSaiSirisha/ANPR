## Overview
The project is the implementation for the results reported in [our](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06657) preprint. 

## How to run:
The code-base adapts the [official CCPD RPNet implementation](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD) for Indian licence plate use-case. The sequence of commands to run the code stays the same. Please refer the official CCPD repository and the CCPR paper for further details.
