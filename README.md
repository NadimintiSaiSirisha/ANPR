## Overview
The project is the implementation for the results reported in [our](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06657) preprint. 

## Directory structure
- `Code_Chinese` contains the official CCPD implementation which forms the backbone of this work.
- `Code_Indian` contains our fork of the CCPD implementation, adapated for 10-digit Indian Number plate recognition.

## Dataset
The dataset used in our work is accessible from Kaggle at [this URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saisirishan/indian-vehicle-dataset).

## How to run:
The code-base adapts the [official CCPD RPNet implementation](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD) for Indian licence plate use-case. The sequence of commands to run the code stays the same. Please refer the official CCPD repository and the CCPR paper for further details.
